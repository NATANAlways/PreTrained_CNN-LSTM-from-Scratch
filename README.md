# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator using CNN-LSTM

This is a Deep Learning mini-project for **EC9170 - Deep Learning for Electrical & Computer Engineers**, University of Jaffna (April 2025). The project implements an end-to-end image captioning system using a custom-built CNN for feature extraction and an LSTM-based decoder for sequence generation.

### ✅ Example 2 – Snowmobile Scene

**Actual Captions**

```
startseq people are riding around on snowmobiles endseq  
startseq people pose with helmets and goggles on while riding snowmobiles endseq  
startseq several people are taking break while on snowmobiling ride endseq  
startseq three people and two snowmobiles endseq  
startseq two helmeted men sit on yellow snowmobiles while another man stands behind watching endseq  
```

**Predicted Caption**

```
startseq two people are on snowmobiling endseq
```

## 🧪 Cross-Validation

* **5-Fold Cross Validation**
* **Average Validation Loss:** 5.8250

## 💡 Limitations & Future Work

### 🔻 Limitations:

* No attention mechanism
* Slight overfitting after 10 epochs
* Lower BLEU-4 (fluency issue)

### 🔺 Suggestions:

* Add attention mechanism
* Try Transformer-based decoder
* Use pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet50)
* Expand dataset + data augmentation
